i had to write a review this time as this occasion has really upset me.
econsult is not meant to be used for under 6 months but this gp surgery insists that you use it and just put a fake dob to bypass econsults measures. it says on econsults website ‘it is not possible for parents to submit econsults for patients below the age of 6 months for safety reasons – these patients should be seen by a clinician.’ so i’m doing what they tell me to do and used the econsult on this occasion, my son is prone to uti’s because of reflux in his kidneys and takes daily antibiotics, i was told by my sons consultant to request medication from my gp surgery when i run out.
i filled out the econsult on 9/10 and received a text message the next day saying ‘could you please provide us with supporting evidence of the medication you are requesting? a copy of prescription or letter or a picture of the last/most recent box with a valid label on it with your name. you can send via e-mail’ i sent a picture of his medication with his name on it after an hour of receiving the text message.
i still hadn’t received his medication on 19/10 so i decided to call and was told by the receptionist that they require a letter from the hospital to say he needs this on repeat and that’s why there is a delay, why was i not told this earlier? apparently they don’t call patients and it is my job to chase up the missing medication and it’s not their fault that i don’t have a letter, but i gave them what they asked for initially which was a picture. after literally begging as my child needs these daily antibiotics they said a gp would call me, however someone else called me and asked for this letter again, i said i don’t have it yet and could take days for me to chase up my sons consultant, what do i do in between? not give my child medication and let him get a uti and have him readmitted? she didn’t care and said she would hang up the phone as she had just called to ask if i had this letter (didn’t want to help an anxious mother with a premature baby or listen to my worries).
gp eventually called me and was lovely and resolved this within minutes as it was on my sons discharge summary when he was admitted into hospital due to his uti, someone obviously didn’t look properly. my problem is not that they required a letter, i would have got that if they had asked for it initially and not given me an option to send a photo of the medication. it was 9 days later and i had 3 days of medication remaining

533,Hazeldene Medical Group Practice,2022-10-24,1.0,"Awful experience 
    ","whenever i have requested medication there has always been a delay or an issue, i was previously left with no testing strips and needles to inject my insulin for 3 days and had to use the same ones as they failed to action my prescription despite using econsult and emailing them. 

i had to write a review this time as this occasion has really upset me.
econsult is not meant to be used for under 6 months but this gp surgery insists that you use it and just put a fake dob to bypass econsults measures. it says on econsults website ‘it is not possible for parents to submit econsults for patients below the age of 6 months for safety reasons – these patients should be seen by a clinician.’ so i’m doing what they tell me to do and used the econsult on this occasion, my son is prone to uti’s because of reflux in his kidneys and takes daily antibiotics, i was told by my sons consultant to request medication from my gp surgery when i run out.
i filled out the econsult on 9/10 and received a text message the next day saying ‘could you please provide us with supporting evidence of the medication you are requesting? a copy of prescription or letter or a picture of the last/most recent box with a valid label on it with your name. you can send via e-mail’ i sent a picture of his medication with his name on it after an hour of receiving the text message.
i still hadn’t received his medication on 19/10 so i decided to call and was told by the receptionist that they require a letter from the hospital to say he needs this on repeat and that’s why there is a delay, why was i not told this earlier? apparently they don’t call patients and it is my job to chase up the missing medication and it’s not their fault that i don’t have a letter, but i gave them what they asked for initially which was a picture. after literally begging as my child needs these daily antibiotics they said a gp would call me, however someone else called me and asked for this letter again, i said i don’t have it yet and could take days for me to chase up my sons consultant, what do i do in between? not give my child medication and let him get a uti and have him readmitted? she didn’t care and said she would hang up the phone as she had just called to ask if i had this letter (didn’t want to help an anxious mother with a premature baby or listen to my worries).
gp eventually called me and was lovely and resolved this within minutes as it was on my sons discharge summary when he was admitted into hospital due to his uti, someone obviously didn’t look properly. my problem is not that they required a letter, i would have got that if they had asked for it initially and not given me an option to send a photo of the medication. it was 9 days later and i had 3 days of medication remaining 
i think the admin team need to have some empathy. 
another point, my twins are now nearly 6 months, they still haven’t had their 16 week immunisations as their appointment has been cancelled twice.",whenever requested medication always delay issue previously left testing strips needles inject insulin 3 days use ones failed action prescription despite using econsult emailing them write review time occasion really upset me econsult meant used 6 months gp surgery insists use put fake dob bypass econsults measures says econsults website ‘it possible parents submit econsults patients age 6 months safety reasons – patients seen clinician’ i’m tell used econsult occasion son prone uti’s reflux kidneys takes daily antibiotics told sons consultant request medication gp surgery run out filled econsult 910 received text message next day saying ‘could please provide us supporting evidence medication requesting copy prescription letter picture lastmost recent box valid label name send via email’ sent picture medication name hour receiving text message still hadn’t received medication 1910 decided call told receptionist require letter hospital say needs repeat that’s delay told earlier apparently don’t call patients job chase missing medication it’s fault don’t letter gave asked initially picture literally begging child needs daily antibiotics said gp would call me however someone else called asked letter again said don’t yet could take days chase sons consultant between give child medication let get uti readmitted didn’t care said would hang phone called ask letter didn’t want help anxious mother premature baby listen worries gp eventually called lovely resolved within minutes sons discharge summary admitted hospital due uti someone obviously didn’t look properly problem required letter would got asked initially given option send photo medication 9 days later 3 days medication remaining think admin team need empathy another point twins nearly 6 months still haven’t 16 week immunisations appointment cancelled twice

    ","i have been a patient at this practice for many years and i have never really had a great experience. the reason for staying is simply that i live close by, along with the the hassle involved with moving surgeries and i worry that the grass may not be greener even if i do move.

it is very hard to get an appointment. the online system is very flawed. earliest appointments are minimum two weeks away. if urgent appointments are required, you have to phone the surgery and they rarely pick up. 

telephone appointments are now the normal and therefore face to face is non-existent. doctors are never on time and it is very impersonal. further, doctors are always being changed and so the idea of a family doctor does not exist. when doctors do call you they do not know even your recent history as they are so unprepared. one has to spend five minutes giving them a background. doctors are also not empathetic to your symptoms and have zero interest in investigating problems. it feels like you have the most severe illnesses in order to get an adequate response from them.  additionally, they have the arrogance to suggest that you go down the private route if you are not happy with their service. it is completely elitist to suggest that.

if they do refer you to hospital, they choose hospitals that are far away. letters are sent late. copies of treatment are not sent. one has to phone for blood test results. in a digital age this is unacceptable.

i have not a good thing to say about this surgery or it’s doctors and staff.

i went in today for my blood test with my usual nurse with which i had no problem booking the appointment with. she is as always very efficient she called my name at the time my appointment was booked so i didn’t have to wait longer. she is always very friendly and helps me be at ease, calming my anxiety. she has always been taking blood for me and i never feel any pain, she is brilliant. if i have any questions she would answer them, never rush me to go. i would like to thank her for her patience with me and being a caring nurse and such a good soul. 
i would also like to thank the new telephone appointment booking service they have. the telephone staff are very pleasant too they answer the phone by greeting  and saying their name which is very good. 
last but not least i would like to thank my doctor for her caring concern greeting  as she saw me on my way out.

    ","i attended the practice with my husband and proceeded to make an appointment for myself. the lady receptionist asked me if i had an appointment and i said no it was for my husband. she motioned me to the touch pad as if i didn’t understand her and i explained we had already checked in. i asked if i could book and appointment for myself. she continued to look at her computer screen and type for a further four minutes. there was no courtesy or even a “ill be with you in a minute”. i then went round to the other side and dealt with a very pleasant young gentleman. 
we do not come to the practice because we have time to spare or are bored. we present with genuine issues when it’s impossible not to attend. to be treated this way is really unacceptable. no one is doing us a favour when we come in as it’s our taxes that fund the nhs. we are entitled to a service and dignity along with that.
